# Doctor and Portals Website

## Description
This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application for a doctor and portal system. It allows patients to book and cancel appointments, and doctors to approve or cancel bookings. This was my first project using PHP for scripting, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. XAMPP is used for the database and local server setup.
